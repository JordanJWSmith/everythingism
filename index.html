    <p class="reveal">Everythingism is why the Government can't have a policy that delivers safe and cheap
        nuclear power quickly. Britain has some of the highest energy prices in the world, and with
        increasing geopolitical instability energy security is a key government priority, yet moving to
        safe and cheap nuclear power is impossible unless it also promotes the Welsh language,
        enhances biodiversity, and upskills the local workforce.</p>

    <p class="reveal">Everythingism is the belief that every proposal, project or policy is a means for promoting
        every national objective, all at the same time. Trade policy is not for getting cheaper goods,
        but for reshaping the global economy. Planning policy is not for getting high-quality housing
        near the best jobs, but creating local jobs, hiring more apprentices, and enhancing
        biodiversity. And Government procurement isn't for the best products and services at the
        cheapest price. It's about promoting “social and economic value”, reshaping the British
        economy to promote Net Zero, regional economic development, and diversity and equality
        training.</p>

    <p class="reveal">Under Everythingism, we never do any one thing well, we do everything poorly. Housing
        policy is the main route for fixing the nitrogen imbalances that farmers create in local rivers,
        and creating more social housing to subsidise the welfare state. Trains must look after our
        bats. Climate policy is to support the services sector.
        Creating jobs, reducing pollution, boosting biodiversity are all laudable policy aims. So how
        can pushing them be bad? Because in each example of Everythingis, the policy is to deliver
        those goals through systems which are fundamentally designed with other objectives in
        mind. The goals aren't always at odds, but often they are. Sometimes that trade-off might be
        worth it, but often it isn't.</p>

    <p class="reveal">
        This isn't a new problem. When Governments have failed in the past, the spectre of
        Everythingism has been there. Concorde was set up to simultaneously be a joint Anglo-
        French industrial project, a demonstration of the most advanced aerospace engineering, and
        commercially viable. The result was a beautiful but financially unsustainable aircraft that only
        a handful of airlines could use, and required massive subsidies to keep it going.
        Britain isn't alone in Everythingism. In the US, Ezra Klein calls this “Everything-Bagel
        Liberalism”, the propensity of policymakers in blue states, especially in leading cities, to see
        any project as an opportunity to advance multiple goals. Affordable housing projects become
        unaffordable because of California's insistence on ideas about perfect development, which
        get in the way of plenty of ones which would be good enough. The security-critical
        semiconductor industry can't build new factories because of the National Environmental
        Policy Act, and Congress insisting on workforce diversity measures at semiconductor sites in
        the Inflation Reduction Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        But Britain is a place where Everythingism is deeply rooted - and a profound problem for the
        country. It isn't just that it feels like everything is going wrong, or that everything needs to be
        fixed. The problem is that we're relying on everything to fix everything else, everywhere, all
        at once. And so nothing works.

    <p class="reveal">The previous Conservative Government rejected plans for a new datacentre right next to the
        M25 on the grounds that it would “significantly alter the character and appearance of the
        area”. The land is currently a disused quarry, next to a major motorway, but its status as part
        of the Green Belt makes it easier to justify vetoing new developments.
        In Bradford, a development to create 140 new homes was delayed because the proposal did
        not adequately consider the speed of cricket balls. Britain's labyrinthine planning system
        builds in so many different requirements that it makes it easy for much needed developments 
        to be blocked on the grounds that they disadvantage any one of a number of
        different goals.</p>

     <p class="reveal">
        There are 27 kinds of public bodies listed by government guidance as statutory consultees
        on different kinds of development, each with their own opportunity to add new requirements
        or request changes to a development. Internationally, we see far more homebuilding, and
        more affordable housing as a result, when jurisdictions allow simple processes which don't
        build in many complex requirements.
     </p>   

    <p class="reveal">Everyone loses from Everythingism.</p>

    <p class="reveal">Everythingism is rarely explicit, but frequently implicit in public policy - a guiding sentiment
        that if policymakers don't use every tool at their disposal to further all objectives, they have
        failed to be imaginative enough. A sentiment which is very appealing to the vested interests
        who want to see their specific objectives furthered regardless of the costs to others, and who
        stand to gain the most from the government trying to 'do it all'.</p>

    <p class="reveal">
        Everythingism is less common in the world of business; it’s rarely tolerated for long by
        competitive markets. Successful teams tend to divide labour and specialise. Successful
        companies are rewarded for focus – it’s impossible to imagine Steve Jobs or Mark
        Zuckerberg starting successful companies by trying a hundred different interconnected
        projects, at the same time, and doing them all badly. Globally, countries succeed based on
        the same principles, specialising in providing the goods and services they are best placed to
        trade.
    </p>
    <p class="reveal">
        Many theories underpin the more focused approach. But all of them are supported by basic
        common sense: you can’t do it all, some ways of doing things are better than others, and
        there are nearly always trade-offs.
    </p>
    <p class="reveal">
        Governments try to advance their objectives through many different complex instruments -
        policies, legislation, economic measures, national infrastructure and public services. Not only
        do they struggle to prioritise between objectives, but also to identify which instruments are
        best used to deliver those objectives.

        Governments try to advance their objectives through many different complex instruments -
        policies, legislation, economic measures, national infrastructure and public services. Not only
        do they struggle to prioritise between objectives, but also to identify which instruments are
        best used to deliver those objectives.
    </p>
    <p class="reveal">
        Policymakers shouldn't ignore complexity. After all, many policy instruments do affect many
        different outcomes, and pretending they don't would be misleading. The world is more
        interconnected than ever; by global markets, the banking system, the internet, and
        unprecedented levels of global migration. The sudden and far-reaching impact of
        pandemics, wars, technological developments and economic crises is proof that
        organisations, systems and countries are more intertwined than ever, and that the system
        requires deep systems-thinking to improve.
    </p>
    <p class="reveal">
        But while complexity is helpful as a description of the situation, it is unhelpful as a
        prescription for action. It might be tempting to believe we can optimise every policy system
        for every policy objective, all at once, but that is fantasy. It leads to distraction, confusion
        about the policy objectives being delivered, and paralysis. Ruthless prioritisation can be
        uncomfortable, but delivering any meaningful change through Everythingism is unrealistic.
    </p>
    <p class="reveal">
        In the past, this kind of focus has rewarded British policymakers who have rejected
        Everythingism. Some have succeeded by ploughing through objections and vested interests,
        and setting clear focus and objectives, particularly in times of national crisis. The Vaccine
        Taskforce depended on officials working outside of the normal processes for procurement,
        hiring and public spending. Academisation in education, which focused on freeing up
        schools to specialise, rather than getting them to do everything everywhere, has been a
        multi-decade success.

    <p class="reveal">Modern developments across numerous fields have breathed new life into these ancient intuitions. Quantum physics has revealed the strange entanglement of particles across vast distances. Ecological sciences have mapped the intricate web of relationships that sustain planetary life. Information theory has provided frameworks for understanding how patterns propagate across seemingly unrelated domains.</p>

    <p class="reveal">These scientific advances have converged with technological developments that make interconnection not just a theoretical concept but a lived reality. The internet, social media, global transportation, and instantaneous communication have created a world where the butterfly effect is no longer merely metaphorical — the actions of individuals can and do ripple across the global system with unprecedented speed and impact.</p>

    <h3 class="reveal">Implications for Knowledge</h3>

    <p class="reveal">If everything is indeed connected to everything else, then our traditional approach to knowledge — dividing reality into discrete disciplines and domains — may be fundamentally limited. The boundaries between physics and biology, between economics and psychology, between art and mathematics begin to appear more as artifacts of our cognitive limitations than as reflections of reality's true structure.</p>

    <p class="reveal">This doesn't mean that specialization has no value. Rather, it suggests that specialists must remain aware of the artificial nature of their boundaries, and develop methods for communicating across these boundaries. Transdisciplinary approaches, meta-frameworks, and comprehensive thinking styles become not just intellectually fashionable but practically necessary.</p>

    <!-- <h2 class="reveal">Living Everythingism</h2> -->

    <p class="reveal">Beyond its theoretical implications, everythingism offers a practical philosophy for navigating an increasingly complex world. It encourages us to be mindful of the extended consequences of our actions, to seek out unexpected connections between problems and solutions, and to maintain intellectual humility in the face of systems whose full complexity exceeds our comprehension.</p>

    <p class="reveal">This philosophy manifests in practical approaches like systems thinking, in cultural movements emphasizing global consciousness, and in technological innovations designed to make connections visible and tangible. It informs emergent forms of governance that acknowledge our interdependence, economic models that account for externalities, and educational approaches that emphasize contextual understanding alongside specialized knowledge.</p>

    <h3 class="reveal">Challenges and Criticisms</h3>

    <p class="reveal">Of course, everythingism is not without its critics. Some argue that it threatens to dissolve important distinctions, leading to a kind of intellectual and moral relativism. Others worry that the emphasis on interconnection can paralyze action by making every decision seem overwhelmingly complex. Still others suggest that everythingism is simply too vague a concept to provide practical guidance in specific situations.</p>

    <p class="reveal">These criticisms merit serious consideration. An everythingist perspective need not deny the utility of boundaries and categories in particular contexts, nor should it prevent decisive action when required. The key lies in maintaining awareness of these boundaries as tools rather than truths — useful for certain purposes, but always provisional and partial.</p>

    <!-- <h2 class="reveal">Conclusion: Toward an Everything Future</h2> -->

    <p class="reveal">As we move deeper into the 21st century, the relevance of everythingism seems likely to grow rather than diminish. The challenges we face — from climate change to artificial intelligence, from pandemic response to economic inequality — all resist siloed approaches and demand integrated understanding.</p>

    <p class="reveal">Perhaps the ultimate promise of everythingism lies not in providing final answers, but in fostering a particular quality of attention — one that remains open to the vast web of relationships that constitute our world, that seeks connections across traditional boundaries, and that approaches complexity not as an obstacle to understanding but as the very substance of the reality we seek to understand.</p>

    <p class="reveal">In embracing everythingism, we may discover that the truth of existence lies not in any particular thing, but in the infinite ways that all things relate to one another — a dynamic, ever-evolving tapestry that we both observe and help to weave.</p>
